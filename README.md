# Convolution-neural-network C++
This is my own test of Convolution neural network use OpenCV. With 2 or 3 Layer feature and Autoencoder
I done this just for fun for my own to try understand and test the principle of Convolution Neural Network 
with supervised learning and unsupervied learning.

Dependancy
1. OpenCV
I was use this way to install OpenCV
http://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/

2. MNIST data set download to program root folder.
