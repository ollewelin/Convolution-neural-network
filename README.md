# Convolution-neural-network C++
This is my own test of Convolution neural network use OpenCV. With 2 or 3 Layer feature and Autoencoder
I done this just for fun for my own to try understand and test the principle of Convolution Neural Network 
with supervised learning and unsupervied learning. I was use Denoising Autoencoder here used for feature unsupervised learning. 
A good explanation by this guy: Hugo Larochelle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzS3tMl4Nsc thanks for that! 

Dependencies
1. OpenCV
I was use this way to install OpenCV
http://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/

2. MNIST data set download to program root folder. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
